# **App Name**: Prabhu Milan Naam Jaap

## Core Features:

- Auto Chant & Count: The app will automatically speak the selected text for chanting, increasing the counter automatically after each 108 counts to signify the completion of a mala.
- Manual Chant & Tap Counter: Users can manually speak and tap within the app, with the counter increasing with each tap, marking a mala completion after every 108 counts.
- Audio Style Selection (AI Tool): Utilize AI to allow the user to select and customize the style of the audio output, potentially mimicking the speech style of notable figures. This tool allows reasoning whether this mimicry will work properly.
- Counter Visualization: Attractive UI designed to resemble a traditional counter counting machine, enhancing the user's chanting experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep saffron (#FF9933), evoking spirituality and focus.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a calm and contemplative atmosphere.
- Accent color: Warm gold (#FFD700) to highlight important elements like the counter and mala completion.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif that will convey a elegant and intellectual feel.
- Use traditional and simple icons for navigation and controls (e.g., mala beads, sound wave, hand tap).
- The counter should be centrally located and prominent. The app's UI will mimic the appearance of a physical tally counter, featuring a prominent display and large, circular button.
- Subtle animations to indicate the counter incrementing, and a celebratory effect upon mala completion (e.g., a gentle ripple or glow).
